# Julia implementation of Hamiltonian-VI

Implementation of variational inference methods based on Hamiltonian dynamics. Specifically, the following two methods are implemented:

- [Hamiltonian importance sampling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11328.pdf) 
- [Uncorrected Hamiltonian annealing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04150)
